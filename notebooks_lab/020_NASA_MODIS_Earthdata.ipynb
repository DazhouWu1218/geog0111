    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use high-level codes from `geog0111` to familiarise ourselves with downloading and interpreting NASA MODIS datasets from [`NASA EarthData`](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov). We will also be visualising these data in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be **introducing NASA MODIS land products**, and viewing the MODIS LAI product as an example. This notebook should serve as an introduction to accessing similar products from Earthdata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the codes here is not to provide an exhaustive interface to MODIS data products, although the same scripts should be useable for most, if not all similar products. Rather, it is to use these high-level codes to easily access and visualise the data to understand their properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neither is it to develop or use an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) to access the data. If all you want is to get hold of some data product for some defined location and time, then you might use an API such as [Appeears](https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Students who take the [GEOG0111 course](https://github.com/UCL-EO/geog0111) will develop codes along similar lines to this later in the term, so for them, these notes also illustrate some of the things they will be able to do when you have finished this course. For them, we will *look under the bonnet* of such codes, and learn how to develop them. For others, they can use these codes as they stand to access MODIS data via Earthdata."
