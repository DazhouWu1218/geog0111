<p>$CO_2$ concentration in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing. The flask measurements collected in Mauna Loa provide a fairly long time series that allows us to see the temporal evolution of this trace gas. </p>
<div class="alert alert-success">

<p>In today's session, we shall consider how to "model" the $CO_2$ record. We'll develop some simple models of $CO_2$ as a function of time, and will try to "fit" them to the data.</p>

<p>The data are available on line from <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html">NOAA</a>. We want the monthly  average dataset, which can be found there.

In this case, because the url is an FTP one we will use the <code>urllib2</code> package rather than requests, that doesn't deal with FTP. We will save it to a file with the same name locally:</p>
<pre><code class="python"># The remote URL for the data file is address:

# Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling
# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
#
# The "average" column contains the monthly mean CO2 mole fraction determined
# from daily averages.  The mole fraction of CO2, expressed as parts per million
# (ppm) is the number of molecules of CO2 in every one million molecules of dried
# air (water vapor removed).  If there are missing days concentrated either early
# or late in the month, the monthly mean is corrected to the middle of the month
# using the average seasonal cycle.  Missing months are denoted by -99.99.
# The "interpolated" column includes average values from the preceding column
# and interpolated values where data are missing.  Interpolated values are
# computed in two steps.  First, we compute for each month the average seasonal
# cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value.  In this way the seasonal
# cycle is allowed to change slowly over time.  We then determine the "trend"
# value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in
# the "trend" column.  Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months.
# The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle
# value and the trend value for the missing month.
#
# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change, 
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.

<p>So this is quite similar to what we had above. There's an average line, an interpolated line, as well as some smoothed trend line. We're interested in the interpolated line.</p>
<h2 id="a-model-for-co_2-concentration">A model for $CO_2$ concentration</h2>
<h3 id="a-linear-trend-model">A linear trend model</h3>
<p>We might be curious about a simple model for $CO_2$ concentration. Perhaps the simplest model is a linear trend, which we can write as the concentration at some time step $i$, $W_i$ being just a linear scaling of the time $t_i$:</p>
<p>$$
W_i = m \cdot t_i + c.
$$</p>
<p>We can define a Python function for this very easily:</p>
<pre><code class="python">def linear_model(p, t):
    m, c = p
    return m * t + c
</code></pre>

<p>We can now try to plot some model trajectories and the data by supplying parameters for the slope ($m$) and intercept ($c$). Let's start by assuming that the slope can be approximated by the difference between minimum and maximum concentrations divided  by the number of timesteps:</p>
<p>$$
m \approx  \frac{411-310}{728}
$$</p>
<p>$c$ is the minimum value, so $c\approx 310$.</p>
<pre><code class="python">n_times = co2.interpolated.shape[0]
max_co2 = co2.interpolated.max()
min_co2 = co2.interpolated.min()
print(f&quot;There are {n_times:d} steps in the data&quot;)
print(f&quot;Maximum CO2 concentration {max_co2:f}&quot;)
print(f&quot;Minimum CO2 concentration {min_co2:f}&quot;)
x = np.arange(n_times)
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=1, figsize=(12, 7))
axs[0].plot(x, co2.interpolated, '-', label=&quot;Measured&quot;)
m = (403. - 305.) / 716
c = 305.
axs[0].plot(x, linear_model([m, c], x), '--', label=&quot;Modelled&quot;)
axs[0].legend(loc=&quot;best&quot;)
axs[1].plot(x, linear_model([m, c], x) - co2.interpolated, 'o', mfc=&quot;none&quot;)
axs[1].axhline(y=0, lw=2, c=&quot;0.8&quot;)
S = np.sum((linear_model([m, c], x) - co2.interpolated)**2)
print(&quot;Sum of squared residuals: {}&quot;.format(S))
</code></pre>

<pre><code>There are 749 steps in the data
Maximum CO2 concentration 417.070000
Minimum CO2 concentration 312.660000
Sum of squared residuals: 15956.69223949002

<p><img alt="png" src="../050_Linear_models_files/050_Linear_models_12_1.png" /></p>
<p>So, not really a great fit... The overall shape is a bit off, and the model isn't really fitting the annual seasonality in the curve. The residuals plot tells us that the residuals aren't really noise around zero: they show a very clear trend, suggesting that <strong>the model is too simple to fit the data</strong>.  </p>
<h3 id="a-quadratic-model">A quadratic model</h3>
<p>Maybe we need a higher order model, like a quadratic model:</p>
<p>$$
W_i = a_0 \cdot t_i^2  + a_1 \cdot t_i + a_2.
$$</p>
<p>In this case, it is a bit harder to eyeball what good starting parameters for $\left[a_0, a_1, a_2\right]$ would be. A strategy for this would be to consider what a good fit would look like, and then use this to define a metric of good fit. A good fit would basically overlap the measurements, being indistinguishable from them. The <em>residual</em> is the difference between the measurement and the model. In this case, it can be positive or negative (whether the model over- or undershoots the observations), but by squaring the residual we get rid of the sign. Then we can add up all the squared residuals, and the best fit will be the one that has the lowest sum of squares. This is in essence the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">method of least squares</a>. Let's see how this works <em>intuitevely</em>: we'll loop over the parameters and plot the different predicted concentrations... First we need our model function...</p>
<pre><code class="python">def quadratic_model(p, t):
    a0, a1, a2 = p
    return a0 * t**2 + a1 * t + a2
</code></pre>

<p>We can get a feeling of what the parameters might be just by eyeballing reading up some points from the graph, and then solving the system manually:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
403 &amp;= a_0\cdot (728)^2 + a_1\cdot (728) + a_2\
340 &amp;= a_0\cdot (300)^2 + a_1\cdot (300) + a_2\
315 &amp;= a_0\cdot (0)^2 + a_1\cdot (0) + a_2\
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>From this, we can get some rough estimates, which in this case are</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a_0 &amp;= 9.5\cdot 10^{-5}\
a_1 &amp;= 5.48\cdot 10^{-2}\
a_2 &amp;= 315.\
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>We can just basically run the model around these numbers and plot the different model predictions with a loop over $a_0$ and another one over $a_1$ (assuming $a_2$ is well defined)</p>
<pre><code class="python">plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))

a2 = 315.
for a0 in np.linspace(1e-5, 20e-5, 10):
    for a1 in np.linspace(1e-2, 10e-2, 10):
        plt.plot(x, quadratic_model([a0, a1, a2], x), '-', lw=0.5, c=&quot;0.8&quot;)

plt.plot(x, co2.interpolated, '-', label=&quot;Measured&quot;)

<p>This is quite complicated, we can see that there might be a good line of fit, but we don't see clearly what parameters provide it! We can store the goodness of fit metric (sum of squared residuals) in a 2D array and then plot it as an image. It should be more obvious where the minimum lies...</p>

<p>So that's pretty interesting, we get a very clear "valley", with a minimum pretty close to where our first rough guess is... The shape is quite interesting: if we start at the first guess point, and move along the $x-$ or $y-$ axes, we quickly go into areas of large error. However, if we move along the diagonal line, we will be in the "trough" of the cost function, provided that when you move "up" (positive $a_0$), you also move "left" (negative $a_1$), or if you move "down" (negative $a_0$), you also move "right" (positive $a_1$). Basically, the cost function does not change if you can get the two parameters to co-operate and compensate the effect of each other.</p>
<p>Let's find out where the actual minimum from our brute-force approach is. We can do this quickly by creating a mask where all the elements are <code>False</code> except where the minimum value of <code>sos</code> is located. We can then use this mask to multiply our <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes and just select the unique values that are larger than 0.</p>
<pre><code class="python">print(f&quot;Best SoS: {sos.min():g}&quot;)
sos_mask = sos == sos.min()
u1 = np.unique(yy[None, :] * sos_mask)
yy_opt = u1[u1 &gt; 0]
u2 = np.unique(xx[:, None] * sos_mask)
xx_opt = u2[u2 &gt; 0]

<p>The Sum of Squares of the first example was  around 15000, so we've improved our modelling by adding an extra (quadratic term). This is usually the case: you can improve your goodness of fit by adding extra terms, but usually at the cost of <em>specialising</em> your model too much to the training data. This will usually result in poor predictive abilities for the model outside the training region. Which isn't cool.</p>
<p>We can plot now the cost function, as well as our first rough guess and the final guess:</p>

<p>So solvng by brute force with a quadratic appears to have worked better than fitting with our linear model. The residuals now mostly lie in the -5 to 5 units range, whereas the linear model had residuals floating around -12 and 12 or thereabouts. It is also clear that we're missing out on the seasonality, and some rates of growth (particularly at the end) seem to be underemphasised.</p>
<h2 id="solving-the-problem-using-linear-algebra">Solving the problem using linear algebra</h2>
<p>So we can see that our brute force search has given us a better fit than eyeballing it, which is what one might expect. It should be possible to solve this analytically. Let's write this as a matrix problem:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}\cdot\vec{x}&amp;=\vec{y}\
\mathbf{A}&amp;=\begin{bmatrix} 
t_1^2 &amp; t_1 &amp; 1 \
t_2^2 &amp; t_2 &amp; 1 \
t_3^2 &amp; t_3 &amp; 1 \
\vdots &amp; \vdots \vdots \
t_N^{2} &amp; t_N &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}\
\vec{x} &amp;=\begin{bmatrix}a_0\a_1\a_2 \end{bmatrix}\
\vec{y} &amp;=\begin{bmatrix}W_1\W_2\W_3\ \vdots \W_N \end{bmatrix}\
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Spend some time satisfying yourself that you understand how the previous matrices and vectors work together.
</div>

<p>So, we see that this is really an overdetermined linear problem, where we've got more observations ($N$) than parameters (3). We can solve this by calculating the pseudo inverse:</p>
<p>$$
\vec{x} = \left[\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{A}  \right]^{-1}\mathbf{A}^{\top}\vec{y},
$$
where $^{\top}$ is the <strong>transpose</strong>, and $^{-1}$ is the inverse matrix. We can solve this problem easily in Python, which can deal with linear algebra nicely. The <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html"><code>np.linalg.lstsq</code></a> method has a direct solver, or you can also work it out by calculating the inverse matrix yourself. The latter approach is usually numerically more unstable, so we won't be looking into it.</p>
<h3 id="solution-using-nplinalglstsq">Solution using <code>np.linalg.lstsq</code></h3>
<p>In this case, we need to define the matrix $\mathbf{A}$. The observations vector $\vec{y}$ is already defined. What is needed is to weed out the invalid measurements in both $\mathbf{A}$ and $\vec{y}$. We then use <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html"><code>np.linalg.lstsq</code></a> to solve the linear overdetermined system. This returns a number of things:</p>

<li>The solution vector.</li>
<li>The sum of squared residuals.</li>
<li>The rank of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$.</li>
<li>The eigenvalues.</li>

<p>The parameters we got from the linear solver are very similar to the brute force method. If we had used a finer grid in the brute force model, we'd get even closer, but at the price of incresing the number of model evaluations. We can also see that using the analytic least squares solution results in the actual minimum of the cost function, not a value close to it.</p>
<p>In the linear algebra case, the procedure is very simple, and provided the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, one is mostly guaranteed a good solution.</p>

<p>So we can see that the optimal value is quite similar to the other two solutions, but results in a better fit (3470 versus 4090). We can see that with this method we can solve for all three parameters, even though our first guess of 315 for $a_2$ was pretty close to the true solution. </p>

<h2 id="a-model-with-seasonality">A model with seasonality</h2>
<p>While the quadratic model appears to go through the centre of the Mauna Loa curve, it clearly misses an important feature: the seasonality of the $CO_2$ concentration. We can't really emulate that behaviour with a simple quadratic function, but need a different model, one that deals with the seasonality. We can think that the seasonality is an additive cosine term, so that our model for $CO_2$ concentration is now</p>
<p>$$
W_i = a_0\cdot t_i^2 + a_1\cdot t_i + a_2 + a_3\cdot \cos\left(2\pi\frac{t_i}{T}  \right),
$$
where $T$ is the period of the seasonality, in this case, annual so $T=12$.</p>
<p>Although the model looks quite ugly, we see that we can write it like a sum (or a <em>linear combination</em>) of some functions ($t^2,\,t,$, the cosine term) weighted by the model parameters $a_0, \cdots, a_3$. So this is a linear model like the ones we've seen before and with which you should be familiar.</p>
<p>In this case, the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix is now given by </p>
<p>$$
\mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}<br />
t_1^2 &amp; t_1 &amp; 1 &amp; \cos \left( 2\pi\frac{t_1}{T}\right)\
t_2^2 &amp; t_2 &amp; 1 &amp; \cos \left( 2\pi\frac{t_2}{T}\right)\
t_3^2 &amp; t_3 &amp; 1 &amp; \cos \left( 2\pi\frac{t_3}{T}\right)\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \
t_N^2 &amp; t_N &amp; 1 &amp; \cos \left( 2\pi\frac{t_N}{T}\right)\

<p>So that's pretty good: by adding a simple cosine term, we can now start to model the annual seasonality in the measurements, and the sum of squared residuals is now further shrunk to around 1500. This is good, but in some ways unsurprising: you're now solving for 4 parameters, rather than 3 or 2 (for the simple linear case), so you have more degrees of freedom, and you expect to be able to fit your data better. </p>
<h2 id="a-phase-shift">A phase shift</h2>
<p>Looking at the residuals, we might decide that there's some mileage in shifting the cosine term a bit to get a better fit. We could do this by adding a phase shift so that the cosine terms would look like</p>
<p>$$
\cos\left[ \frac{2\pi}{T}(t+\phi)\right]
$$</p>
<p>However, it'd be hard to guess $\phi$ (we've effectively assumed it was 0 radians above!). So we'd need to use some non-linear solving approach. However, we might exploit the following trigonometrical identity:</p>
<p>$$
A\cos(\theta) + B\sin(\theta)=C\sin(\theta + \phi),
$$</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
Can you prove the above identity?

<p>This means that we can just add (drumroll...) yet another term to our model (a sine term), and the ratio of the cosine and sine terms will result in a phase shift.
