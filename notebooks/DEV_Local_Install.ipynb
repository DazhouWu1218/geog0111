    "These notes describe how to set up a full installation of the software for this course on your computer. You will need access to the internet, both to download software, and to a more limited extent during the course, to download data. We can call this installation a 'full native' installation, as we will be installing all of the software you need to run the course directly. Other options for running include:\n",

    "To do a full installation of these notes on your Windows 10 computer, you need to be able to install software that doesn't come from the microsoft store. To do this, you should first check what version of windows you are running.\n",

    "At the prompt at the bottom left of your screen (`Type here to search`), type `About your PC`. This will bring up the settings window, in the `About` section. \n",

    "Scroll down to the section `Windows specifications` and note the `Edition` field. If this says `Home edition`, then you will need to upgrade your version of Windows 10. Note also what is in the `Edition` field. It may say `Pro` or `Enterprise`. These is probably ok, but if it says anything else we reccommend you use `Windows 10 Education` edition, verions `1909` or later (e.g. `2004`). Even if you use `Pro` or `Enterprise`, you should update your system to edition to at least `1909`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update, navigate in a browser to [UCL software database](http://swdb.ucl.ac.uk/?filter=windows%2010), entering your UCL login and password as prompted. Look under the `Downloads` tab, for `Windows 10 1909` or `Windows 10 2004`. You will most likely want to to use 64-bit, rather than 32-bit versions. Follow the instructions to upgrade to the Student Edition. This will probably only involvce installing a new software key, but you should consider backing up any important files from your system before doing this. "
